; Write a program in the assembly language that computes the following arithmetic expression, considering the following data types for the variables:
; a - byte, b - word
; (b / a * 2 + 10) * b - b * 15;
; ex. 1: a = 10; b = 40; Result: (40 / 10 * 2 + 10) * 40 - 40 * 15 = 18 * 40 - 1600 = 720 - 600 = 120
; ex. 2: a = 100; b = 50; Result: (50 / 100 * 2 + 10) * 50 - 50 * 15 = 12 * 50 - 750 = 600 - 750 = - 150

; declare the EntryPoint (a label defining the very first instruction of the program)

; declare external functions needed by our program
extern exit               ; tell nasm that exit exists even if we won't be defining it
import exit msvcrt.dll    ; exit is a function that ends the calling process. It is defined in msvcrt.dll
                          ; msvcrt.dll contains exit, printf and all the other important C-runtime specific functions

; our data is declared here (the variables needed by our program)

    a db 10

; our code starts here

        push    dword 0      ; push the parameter for exit onto the stack
        call    [exit]       ; call exit to terminate the program
